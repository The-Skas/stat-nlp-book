, but with different flocks [/BAR] [BAR] With different destinations , our ships remain docked [/BAR] [BAR] Temporary , but
the feelings that I harbor stil wade [/BAR] [BAR] In the holy waters that made our sweet lemonaid [/BAR] [BAR]
Too dumb to persist , too smart to persuade [/BAR] [BAR] Too heavy to push aside and too stong to
stay [/BAR] [BAR] Too hard to work and so easy to play [/BAR] [BAR] Like chopsticks , what I picked
slipped away [/BAR] [BAR] Leaving me to recollect day by day [/BAR] [BAR] And take solace in the words Bill
say [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] Memories take you back , to the good times [/BAR]
[BAR] When it 's over and sad times disappear [/BAR] [BAR] Memories take you back [/BAR] [BAR] To the lean
times , in between times [/BAR] [BAR] To the days of yesteryear [/BAR] [BAR] Memories are that way [/BAR] [BAR]
[/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 2 ] [/BAR] [BAR] Memories are that way , that way back to that way back
[/BAR] [BAR] When I could never think of you and say " wack " [/BAR] [BAR] Similar to old cassettes
, something to cuss at [/BAR] [BAR] Deteriorating with each rewind and playback [/BAR] [BAR] Even now , one of
the hits I remenice [/BAR] [BAR] On this angelic face , reciplicating bliss [/BAR] [BAR] With the radio low ,
your feet anchored in mine [/BAR] [BAR] Hands to waistline , walking to a bassline [/BAR] [BAR] Good food in
my belly , good love on my mind [/BAR] [BAR] Turn around to a kiss deep enough to stop time
[/BAR] [BAR] Open up to a smile so bright , I go blind [/BAR] [BAR] To the suffering of the
world , everything appears fine [/BAR] [BAR] Poetry in the bed , literally [/BAR] [BAR] You putting me open to
Stephanie and Giovanni [/BAR] [BAR] With legs entwined , trading profound lines [/BAR] [BAR] Fingers and spines aligned , digging
in your mind like it 's mine [/BAR] [BAR] Sometimes at night it seem so damn right [/BAR] [BAR] Just
to shift nose to neck , just to get a whiff [/BAR] [BAR] I 've never seen life like this
, so life-like [/BAR] [BAR] This is how I 'd like my life to subsist [/BAR] [BAR] But somewhere in
between us were interpetations [/BAR] [BAR] Of justice and Jesus , cultures in said nations [/BAR] [BAR] But if I
woulda knew what I know now , mighta never known how [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR]
Memories take you back , to the good times [/BAR] [BAR] When it 's over [/BAR] [BAR] I searched a
thousand skies before you came [/BAR] [BAR] And in the morning , when the world is new [/BAR] [BAR] The
lonely turn away , as I turn to you , beside me [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 3 ]
[/BAR] [BAR] The greatest story ever erased and never replaced [/BAR] [BAR] The worst torture ever I faced [/BAR] [BAR]
Was trying to retrace the steps in my mind [/BAR] [BAR] Like a defeated surgeon fighting fate with the cure
[/BAR] [BAR] Just a little too late [/BAR] [BAR] We went from " Yo , who 's that ? "
to " Hi , my name is Jay " [/BAR] [BAR] To hoping I would run into you in the
hallway [/BAR] [BAR] To " That 's my homegirl , peace queen , how ya been ? " [/BAR] [BAR]
To " Lemme get your number , damn do I have a pen ? " [/BAR] [BAR] From " May
I speak to please , who 's this ? to 'Hey ! ' " [/BAR] [BAR] To hear the joy
in your voice I call you every day [/BAR] [BAR] The VCR blue screen lit the dark room [/BAR] [BAR]
Miles and Gil , " Quiet Nights " that was our tune [/BAR] [BAR] But fridays dates and saturdays prayer
[/BAR] [BAR] Lead to sundays break-up , and mondays make-up [/BAR] [BAR] As just friends up until tuesdays wake up
[/BAR] [BAR] Together again , in a cycle that never ends [/BAR] [BAR] My young heart coulda swore love transcends
[/BAR] [BAR] But two turntables alone do n't make a blend [/BAR] [BAR] The tracks are too different for "
ifs , buts and sos " [/BAR] [BAR] But if it 's so right ? [/BAR] [BAR] Never mind ,
we both know [/BAR] [BAR] Sometimes I wonder if you married my replacement [/BAR] [BAR] Equally old with ideas adjacent
[/BAR] [BAR] You build a whole nother story to your dream house [/BAR] [BAR] Kept my possessions in a box
in the basement [/BAR] [BAR] I stil consider you a song bird , singing in the open cage [/BAR] [BAR]
Guilded with fools gold , but that 's just me [/BAR] [BAR] There never be no animocity , I 'm
thankful for the memories [/BAR] [BAR] All I ask is that you remember me [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus
] [/BAR] [BAR] In the silence of the city night [/BAR] [BAR] When the lonely watch the sky in yearning
[/BAR] [BAR] I , at rest , lie in peace beside you [/BAR] [BAR] I searched a thousand skies before
you came [/BAR] [BAR] And in the morning , when the world is new [/BAR] [BAR] The lonely turn away
, as I turn to you , beside me [/BAR] [BAR] And in the quiet of the afternoon , when
the lonely roam [/BAR] [BAR] I turn beside , and you are with me stil [/BAR] [BAR] I roamed a
thousand miles before you came [/BAR] [BAR] [ Black Thought ] [/BAR] [BAR] The name of the brother to blame

names the same [/BAR] [BAR] Do n't question my ability , in a studio facility [/BAR] [BAR] As I utilize
my God-given utility [/BAR] [BAR] On time , I get behind and push along a rhyme [/BAR] [BAR] of mine
, which I design , with what ? The mind [/BAR] [BAR] Leave MC 's blind with amnesia [/BAR] [BAR]
Chop 'em into salad and my name ai n't Caesar [/BAR] [BAR] Think twice before you approach [/BAR] [BAR] Get
benched by the coach like exit post [/BAR] [BAR] I wrote murder , so you can say it 's Murder
He Wrote [/BAR] [BAR] You think I 'm Hell sent , so you repent to the Pope [/BAR] [BAR] Do
n't walk when the sign says not to [/BAR] [BAR] And do n't talk when Black Thought 's about to

rhyme in your mind , then do n't say it [/BAR] [BAR] Save it for the weaker , pack your
portable speaker [/BAR] [BAR] and utilize the treads on your sneaker [/BAR] [BAR] Take your sorry crew back and forget
about rappin' [/BAR] [BAR] Forget you ever saw me and forget this ever happened [/BAR] [BAR] 'Cause you might have
nightmares of MC 's bein' slain [/BAR] [BAR] And I 'll be to blame when you go insane [/BAR] [BAR]

[BAR] [ J-Live ] [/BAR] [BAR] I tell you what , I pledge allegiance to the people not the flag

bitchin for [/BAR] [BAR] And wonder why the innocent ai n't even snitchin for 'em [/BAR] [BAR] You just as
dangerous as criminals , so pick your poison [/BAR] [BAR] Part of the problem that refuses to relate [/BAR] [BAR]
Turn the hood to a trap , very few can escape [/BAR] [BAR] Like the Word that precedes it -
neighbor [/BAR] [BAR] But if it ai n't the cops , it 's somebody else 's neighborhood watch [/BAR] [BAR]
As the money turns your block from hot to the new hot spot [/BAR] [BAR] Now it 's someone else
's neighborhood , watch how police get along with them [/BAR] [BAR] The storm troopers think the whole hood is

with a [/BAR] [BAR] scholarship to hoop , Colin Powell or Snoop [/BAR] [BAR] Hands on the steering wheel ,
thrown for a loop [/BAR] [BAR] Hands up , wallet out , screaming , " Do n't shoot ! "

neglected [/BAR] [BAR] Confounding the cause for the effected [/BAR] [BAR] Children , women and men subjected [/BAR] [BAR] to
a stop and frisk puts pride and lives at risk [/BAR] [BAR] Heartbeats on pause , if not stop [/BAR]
[BAR] And probable cause is probably cause we black and y 'all cops [/BAR] [BAR] No apologies , but apologists
say not all police - Shh . . . Please ! [/BAR] [BAR] When you 're treated less than human
by a beast [/BAR] [BAR] It does n't matter if it 's the whole beast or nothing but the beast

it ? Goddamn it ! [/BAR] [BAR] Good constable , if I was hiding [/BAR] [BAR] behind the same shield
I should feel responsible [/BAR] [BAR] But when a black child of God is dead [/BAR] [BAR] and you 're
dead wrong , why you only able to respond [/BAR] [BAR] defensive for beating the defenseless senseless ? [/BAR] [BAR]
When we mourn and protest , pursuit is relentless [/BAR] [BAR] But what about pursuit of justice ? What happened
to the [/BAR] [BAR] People verses ? When it’s police verses people like US [/BAR] [BAR] Victims are discussed with
disdain [/BAR] [BAR] and disgust , fear , hate and distrust [/BAR] [BAR] Hard to win hearts and minds [/BAR]
[BAR] when you lose 'em and you break 'em at the same damn time [/BAR] [BAR] How many hearts and
minds and bodies are confined [/BAR] [BAR] just for being indicted of the same exact crime ? [/BAR] [BAR] But
ca n't afford the kind of defense that 's unionized [/BAR] [BAR] Weaponized and never repents , the standards [/BAR]
[BAR] are doubled like sentences [/BAR] [BAR] Like what the 4th 8th and 13th Amendment is ? [/BAR] [BAR] Did
you forget ? Cause the facts do n't add up to the stats [/BAR] [BAR] When the deck and dice

process of law , so it 's very apparent that the police only [/BAR] [BAR] in our community are not

] [/BAR] [BAR] Aiyo , how many times have you seen it [/BAR] [BAR] The local boy makes good around
your hood [/BAR] [BAR] With a style you could n't knock unless you tried it [/BAR] [BAR] But gettin props
is a whole other mission [/BAR] [BAR] Cause crowd participation is a from of rebutrition [/BAR] [BAR] See , time
is the filter that you have to sift through [/BAR] [BAR] Cause now you 're just a act people have
to sit through [/BAR] [BAR] Before the show stoppers pay twice as much as you [/BAR] [BAR] But frankly ,
guess who the crowd came to see ? [/BAR] [BAR] Especially the ones that show up two hours early [/BAR]
[BAR] Just to pack up the front , put yourself in they shoes [/BAR] [BAR] We ai n't got time
for new jacks that 's tryin to pay dues [/BAR] [BAR] You lose , because I got the tired-leg blues
[/BAR] [BAR] You 're unknown , just like them 50 '000 other crews [/BAR] [BAR] So I 'ma either play
the back or you can hear the boo 's [/BAR] [BAR] So when you wonder why it 's so quiet
you 're hearin crickets [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm savin my energy for the names on the ticket [/BAR] [BAR] Matter

[/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ VERSE 3 ] [/BAR] [BAR] So let 's see , as we break this down
logically [/BAR] [BAR] On bleak and firm premises , the crowd wants to murder ya [/BAR] [BAR] Because they never
heard of ya [/BAR] [BAR] But do you quit it , wishin you never woulda did it [/BAR] [BAR] Or
stay committted , and come with it ? [/BAR] [BAR] Well , I prefer the latter , cause time flies
[/BAR] [BAR] And if you 're dope , you get a deal and watch your pockets get fatter [/BAR] [BAR]
And even if you 're wack you 'll probably get a deal anyway [/BAR] [BAR] Cause nowadays , come on
, look around : it do n't matter [/BAR] [BAR] Besides , what 's your option ? Put your hard
work up for adaption ? [/BAR] [BAR] And climb back down from the middle of the ladder ? [/BAR] [BAR]
I rather break the mics and the lights [/BAR] [BAR] And lick a shot up in the air just to
watch the crowd scatter [/BAR] [BAR] But nah , cause then you mess it up for the few true [/BAR]
[BAR] Hardcore heads that give credit where the credit is due [/BAR] [BAR] Guaranteed that if you keep it dedicated
to them [/BAR] [BAR] They 'll turn around and dedicate it to you [/BAR] [BAR] Like yo [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]

[/BAR] [BAR] The no big deal side [/BAR] [BAR] Where staying alive was no problem [/BAR] [BAR] The other east
side [/BAR] [BAR] Projects and condos [/BAR] [BAR] Somewhere in between downtown and harlem [/BAR] [BAR] It 's not quite
accurate to claim half [/BAR] [BAR] Either side was ever either all this or all that [/BAR] [BAR] Some projects
apartments be decked out fat [/BAR] [BAR] Some condos still packed with roaches and rats [/BAR] [BAR] But if New
York is a concrete Jungle [/BAR] [BAR] My old earth kept me in the zoo where it wasnt so wild
[/BAR] [BAR] Who would n't want to find a way to make it safe for a child [/BAR] [BAR] As
a teenager I learned to escape for awhile [/BAR] [BAR] But you know what they say being out of your
element [/BAR] [BAR] Whether giraffe , monkey , lion , or elephant [/BAR] [BAR] In school they said I was
on the right track [/BAR] [BAR] But in the school of hard knocks I done got left back [/BAR] [BAR]
Nowadays no knocks get left [/BAR] [BAR] My left knocks back [/BAR] [BAR] Some say might makes right [/BAR] [BAR]
So my rights ai n't light [/BAR] [BAR] But whether giving beatdowns or getting down on beat [/BAR] [BAR] You
're not likely to see me or consider me street [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus } [/BAR] [BAR] But

life ai n't fair [/BAR] [BAR] From the sidewalks I see how the gas do n't last [/BAR] [BAR] In
the streets and you crash when you go too fast [/BAR] [BAR] From the sidewalks trust shit is Just as

destroy cause that 's how I was taught [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm feeling Philly for now , I do n't
get home sick [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm still close enough to the Yanks , Giants , and Knicks [/BAR] [BAR]
It 's still city to city Just different bricks [/BAR] [BAR] See I do n't divide by places , man
fuck that shit [/BAR] [BAR] It 's a different state , but similar state of mind [/BAR] [BAR] See every
city got the same theme underlined [/BAR] [BAR] A battleground for the lives of the dumb and blind [/BAR] [BAR]
Ya heard ? [/BAR] [BAR] Please believe that it takes all kinds [/BAR] [BAR] We all got to get over
in our own way [/BAR] [BAR] Place to stay , peace to lay , and a pay day [/BAR] [BAR]

hold it down [/BAR] [BAR] On my own when I come through and visit your town [/BAR] [BAR] From the
sidewalks , Chris Rock got you gassed [/BAR] [BAR] But I 'm that smarter than y 'all nigga that 'll
whoop your ass [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 3 ] { J-Live } [/BAR] [BAR] Yo , from the
sidewalks , I been watching Hip-Hop grow [/BAR] [BAR] And vice versa from school battles to my own show [/BAR]

the dough [/BAR] [BAR] I seen people influenced by the next man's flow [/BAR] [BAR] To the point that it
controls where they content go [/BAR] [BAR] But if there 's 8 million stories and a handful of rappers [/BAR]
[BAR] We ca n't all be pimps , players , and gunclappers [/BAR] [BAR] It sounds sexy coming out your
stereo , right ? [/BAR] [BAR] But then you wonder why we still getting stereotyped [/BAR] [BAR] Like we a
whole generation of [/BAR] [BAR] Want to be thugs and soon to be hoes [/BAR] [BAR] Like that 's Just
how it go [/BAR] [BAR] But everybody in the city ai n't ghetto [/BAR] [BAR] We all not slanging rocks
and toatin' metal and [/BAR] [BAR] Everybody in the ghetto ai n't gangster [/BAR] [BAR] Waiting for a reason to
stomp , shoot , and shank ya , and [/BAR] [BAR] Every gangster in the ghetto ai n't stupid as
you [/BAR] [BAR] Advocating that bullshit the way that you do [/BAR] [BAR] Like there 's no consequences or repercussions
[/BAR] [BAR] Like we do n't even think first , before we start bustin' [/BAR] [BAR] But whatever 's clever
son , I let them tell it [/BAR] [BAR] Why should I play the role of zealot Just for y
'all to repel it [/BAR] [BAR] I 'd rather rep for the rest of us with real talk [/BAR] [BAR]
