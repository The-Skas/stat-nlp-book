[BAR] Ca n't even call this a blues song [/BAR] [BAR] It 's been so long [/BAR] [BAR] Neither one
of us was wrong or anything like that [/BAR] [BAR] It seems like yesterday [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus
] [/BAR] [BAR] In the silence of the city night [/BAR] [BAR] When the lonely watch the sky in yearning
[/BAR] [BAR] I , at rest , lie in peace beside you [/BAR] [BAR] I searched a thousand skies before
you came [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 1 ] [/BAR] [BAR] For the 4th 3rd , I Chris Columbus
three words from Stevie for the issue [/BAR] [BAR] The only thing to call it was official [/BAR] [BAR] The
way I live for you was as if I die with you [/BAR] [BAR] Cause not a moment I spent
with you was artifical [/BAR] [BAR] The plan from the dome was to build a home with you [/BAR] [BAR]
Forever had a space in my heart , I roam with you [/BAR] [BAR] Hypothetical dreams conjure when I met
you [/BAR] [BAR] See , years grew between us and stil I ca n't forget you [/BAR] [BAR] Regretting how
I ever let you let me let you escape fools paradise [/BAR] [BAR] Running from a paradox [/BAR] [BAR] Living
like a pair of ducks , but with different flocks [/BAR] [BAR] With different destinations , our ships remain docked
[/BAR] [BAR] Temporary , but the feelings that I harbor stil wade [/BAR] [BAR] In the holy waters that made
our sweet lemonaid [/BAR] [BAR] Too dumb to persist , too smart to persuade [/BAR] [BAR] Too heavy to push
aside and too stong to stay [/BAR] [BAR] Too hard to work and so easy to play [/BAR] [BAR] Like
chopsticks , what I picked slipped away [/BAR] [BAR] Leaving me to recollect day by day [/BAR] [BAR] And take
solace in the words Bill say [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] Memories take you back ,
to the good times [/BAR] [BAR] When it 's over and sad times disappear [/BAR] [BAR] Memories take you back
[/BAR] [BAR] To the lean times , in between times [/BAR] [BAR] To the days of yesteryear [/BAR] [BAR] Memories
are that way [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 2 ] [/BAR] [BAR] Memories are that way , that way
back to that way back [/BAR] [BAR] When I could never think of you and say " wack " [/BAR]
[BAR] Similar to old cassettes , something to cuss at [/BAR] [BAR] Deteriorating with each rewind and playback [/BAR] [BAR]
Even now , one of the hits I remenice [/BAR] [BAR] On this angelic face , reciplicating bliss [/BAR] [BAR]
With the radio low , your feet anchored in mine [/BAR] [BAR] Hands to waistline , walking to a bassline
[/BAR] [BAR] Good food in my belly , good love on my mind [/BAR] [BAR] Turn around to a kiss
deep enough to stop time [/BAR] [BAR] Open up to a smile so bright , I go blind [/BAR] [BAR]
To the suffering of the world , everything appears fine [/BAR] [BAR] Poetry in the bed , literally [/BAR] [BAR]
You putting me open to Stephanie and Giovanni [/BAR] [BAR] With legs entwined , trading profound lines [/BAR] [BAR] Fingers
and spines aligned , digging in your mind like it 's mine [/BAR] [BAR] Sometimes at night it seem so
damn right [/BAR] [BAR] Just to shift nose to neck , just to get a whiff [/BAR] [BAR] I 've
never seen life like this , so life-like [/BAR] [BAR] This is how I 'd like my life to subsist
[/BAR] [BAR] But somewhere in between us were interpetations [/BAR] [BAR] Of justice and Jesus , cultures in said nations
[/BAR] [BAR] But if I woulda knew what I know now , mighta never known how [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR]
[ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] Memories take you back , to the good times [/BAR] [BAR] When it 's over
[/BAR] [BAR] I searched a thousand skies before you came [/BAR] [BAR] And in the morning , when the world
is new [/BAR] [BAR] The lonely turn away , as I turn to you , beside me [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]
[BAR] [ Verse 3 ] [/BAR] [BAR] The greatest story ever erased and never replaced [/BAR] [BAR] The worst torture
ever I faced [/BAR] [BAR] Was trying to retrace the steps in my mind [/BAR] [BAR] Like a defeated surgeon
fighting fate with the cure [/BAR] [BAR] Just a little too late [/BAR] [BAR] We went from " Yo ,
who 's that ? " to " Hi , my name is Jay " [/BAR] [BAR] To hoping I would
run into you in the hallway [/BAR] [BAR] To " That 's my homegirl , peace queen , how ya
been ? " [/BAR] [BAR] To " Lemme get your number , damn do I have a pen ? "
[/BAR] [BAR] From " May I speak to please , who 's this ? to 'Hey ! ' " [/BAR]
[BAR] To hear the joy in your voice I call you every day [/BAR] [BAR] The VCR blue screen lit
the dark room [/BAR] [BAR] Miles and Gil , " Quiet Nights " that was our tune [/BAR] [BAR] But
fridays dates and saturdays prayer [/BAR] [BAR] Lead to sundays break-up , and mondays make-up [/BAR] [BAR] As just friends
up until tuesdays wake up [/BAR] [BAR] Together again , in a cycle that never ends [/BAR] [BAR] My young
heart coulda swore love transcends [/BAR] [BAR] But two turntables alone do n't make a blend [/BAR] [BAR] The tracks
are too different for " ifs , buts and sos " [/BAR] [BAR] But if it 's so right ?
[/BAR] [BAR] Never mind , we both know [/BAR] [BAR] Sometimes I wonder if you married my replacement [/BAR] [BAR]
Equally old with ideas adjacent [/BAR] [BAR] You build a whole nother story to your dream house [/BAR] [BAR] Kept
my possessions in a box in the basement [/BAR] [BAR] I stil consider you a song bird , singing in
the open cage [/BAR] [BAR] Guilded with fools gold , but that 's just me [/BAR] [BAR] There never be
no animocity , I 'm thankful for the memories [/BAR] [BAR] All I ask is that you remember me [/BAR]
[BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] In the silence of the city night [/BAR] [BAR] When the lonely
watch the sky in yearning [/BAR] [BAR] I , at rest , lie in peace beside you [/BAR] [BAR] I
searched a thousand skies before you came [/BAR] [BAR] And in the morning , when the world is new [/BAR]
[BAR] The lonely turn away , as I turn to you , beside me [/BAR] [BAR] And in the quiet
of the afternoon , when the lonely roam [/BAR] [BAR] I turn beside , and you are with me stil

Yo , right about now , my mind is yours and , [/BAR] [BAR] Your mind is yours , for
a gain or a loss , [/BAR] [BAR] Whether accept or reject , perfect or defect [/BAR] [BAR] Turn up

[BAR] I know this because somehow someway is this shit you heard [/BAR] [BAR] And the time and the place
where bullshit 's preferred [/BAR] [BAR] The odds of even oppurtunity is absurd [/BAR] [BAR] But yo , right about

Okay , just relax , get very comfortable [/BAR] [BAR] Relax , trust me , close your eyes , now
just listen for a moment [/BAR] [BAR] Listen to the sounds of the room around you [/BAR] [BAR] Remember that
you are in a studio , a recording studio , [/BAR] [BAR] With your name on one mat [/BAR] [BAR]
You 're in the mic booth , you look around [/BAR] [BAR] It 's one huge empty mic booth [/BAR]
[BAR] You notice that the walls are painted in black [/BAR] [BAR] The mic is black , the windows tinted
black [/BAR] [BAR] And all you can see is a very old computer screen [/BAR] [BAR] Five letters flashing on
and off [/BAR] [BAR] You can barely see what the letters spell [/BAR] [BAR] You lean closer to the screen
, the letters become clearer [/BAR] [BAR] And the word is rhyme [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 3 ]
[/BAR] [BAR] Ayo I 'm trapped in the mind of a mad man literally [/BAR] [BAR] It 's not a
metaphor kid , pay attention [/BAR] [BAR] Reporting to you live from this first dimension [/BAR] [BAR] In the real
crowded room , I just want some attention [/BAR] [BAR] And since you lack the bright , like high beams
at night [/BAR] [BAR] The silence of the noise is deafenin' to hear [/BAR] [BAR] My lack long vision is
the jack of a position [/BAR] [BAR] But I ca n't tell if I 'm in the front of the
rear [/BAR] [BAR] Formless I do n't know if I 'm a circle or square [/BAR] [BAR] Let alone solid
liquid or air [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm completing myself [/BAR] [BAR] But ca n't confirm or deny if I 'm
actually here [/BAR] [BAR] That 's quite a fucked-up predicament , yeah [/BAR] [BAR] I fell at home but I
gotta escape [/BAR] [BAR] This paradox in a box , I 'm intent to solve this mystery [/BAR] [BAR] I
'm made up of dreams and nightmares [/BAR] [BAR] Soliloquies , dialogues , arguments [/BAR] [BAR] Fantasies , memories ,
imagery , symmetry , alcohol , history [/BAR] [BAR] Love , life , death , joy , remorse and sympathy
[/BAR] [BAR] Actions , wishes , reactin' and hopin' [/BAR] [BAR] But everytime the beat comes the door opens [/BAR]
[BAR] The out-of-our-body experience is showing me [/BAR] [BAR] Jettin' from the exit , the entrance , the outlet [/BAR]
[BAR] I 'm strapplin' through veins , blood vessels and muscle tissue [/BAR] [BAR] Till it goes pitch black ,
and I still do n't know if I 'm out yet [/BAR] [BAR] I wake up from the blackout ,
finish with the race [/BAR] [BAR] Confined in a two-dimensional blank space [/BAR] [BAR] Looking back on my original birth
place [/BAR] [BAR] Now taking the shape of a young black face [/BAR] [BAR] Parts of my physical erased and
replaced [/BAR] [BAR] What was sight and sound is now feel and taste [/BAR] [BAR] I * * tal a
fruit punch laced with toothpaste [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm shot from a cannon with amazing grace [/BAR] [BAR] My identity
revealed with the mystery solved [/BAR] [BAR] I see my purpose in life as I travel through time [/BAR] [BAR]
Ridin' the beat through audio wires recording venaire [/BAR] [BAR] Waves hit your minds , I 'm a J-Live rhyme
[/BAR] [BAR] I like how , when you turn the intercom up [/BAR] [BAR] Like all that little background noise

Yo , [/BAR] [BAR] He woke up in a daze , back achin' [/BAR] [BAR] Breath smellin' like liquor ,
dick smellin' like sex [/BAR] [BAR] Head throbbin' like the bass from the club last night [/BAR] [BAR] No idea
how he left [/BAR] [BAR] Needless to say , perplexed [/BAR] [BAR] As he looked around the room that he
never been in [/BAR] [BAR] Candles all around the bed , sheets quite feminine [/BAR] [BAR] Bucked naked with his
kicks on [/BAR] [BAR] Breakaway jeans , drawers and sweater were all on the bedroom floor [/BAR] [BAR] He heard
singin' from the shower from the bathroom door [/BAR] [BAR] Sounded like Melvin Moore but he could n't be sure
[/BAR] [BAR] She had a sexy ass voice but she was so off-key [/BAR] [BAR] Could n't 'member how she
looked , could n't wait to see [/BAR] [BAR] Hopin' that it was the girl , third floor of the
club [/BAR] [BAR] The one that let him grab her ass when they twisted the dub [/BAR] [BAR] Or perhaps
it was the dime from the guest list line [/BAR] [BAR] Either one and several others would 've suited him
fine [/BAR] [BAR] From the bed to the bathroom , a voice said " come in " [/BAR] [BAR] Gradually
now , he starts to remember [/BAR] [BAR] Peeped through the shower curtain , like bachelor number three [/BAR] [BAR]
Pleasantly surprised to see that it was the bartender [/BAR] [BAR] And tender was the operative word [/BAR] [BAR] She
had a body like a cello with legs , I mean , the ass was absurd [/BAR] [BAR] Long neck
, smooth skin , pretty face , kooky nipples [/BAR] [BAR] Eyes wider than hips , full lips between dimples
[/BAR] [BAR] She said " how did you sleep ? " [/BAR] [BAR] He said he did n't know [/BAR]
[BAR] She asked " was it good for you too ? " [/BAR] [BAR] " I think so , but
I really ca n't remember what went down last night " [/BAR] [BAR] She told him " take off your
shoes , we can replay the highlights " [/BAR] [BAR] Stepped out the shower in a daze , legs achin'
[/BAR] [BAR] Breath short from the ? ? ? , dick wrapped in a hat [/BAR] [BAR] Wide open cuz
it was the last from a twelve-pack [/BAR] [BAR] Spit four in the shower till his tire went flat [/BAR]
[BAR] She thought he was all that [/BAR] [BAR] She said " I do n't have to work today [/BAR]
[BAR] Take a little nap so we can do it again " [/BAR] [BAR] No sooner than she said it
, keys jingled , door slammed [/BAR] [BAR] He said " please baby , please do n't let it be
your boyfriend [/BAR] [BAR] For the love of basketball , Mademoiselle , look [/BAR] [BAR] I ai n't Biggie Smalls
, I do n't even want a story to tell [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm a lover , not a fighter
, alright " [/BAR] [BAR] But then a girl walked in [/BAR] [BAR] Saw him naked and said " What
the hell ? " [/BAR] [BAR] Time stood still as he thought to himself , [/BAR] [BAR] " This reminds
me of a beer commercial back in the day " [/BAR] [BAR] She 's too young to be her mother
, so he asked , [/BAR] [BAR] " How you doin' ? Would you care to join in ? "
[/BAR] [BAR] She said , " nigga is you crazy ? [/BAR] [BAR] See this ring on my finger ?
That 's my wife you was fuckin' [/BAR] [BAR] My name ai n't Ronald ? ? ? , do n't
try to play me out " [/BAR] [BAR] She reached in her purse for the little pearl handle [/BAR] [BAR]
He splashed her in the face with the wax from the candle [/BAR] [BAR] The 'tender ran back into the
bathroom , screamin' [/BAR] [BAR] Slipped on the condom wrapper , broke her pretty little neck [/BAR] [BAR] The burnt-face
wife pulled a gun on the dude [/BAR] [BAR] Famous last words : " I ai n't mean you no
disrespect ! " [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Talking ] [/BAR] [BAR] Wow ! That was crazy [/BAR] [BAR] Yo
J , that was cool and all ( uh huh ) [/BAR] [BAR] But what 's up with the violent
ending , man ? [/BAR] [BAR] Is it possible for it to end a little more pleasant ? [/BAR] [BAR]
[/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] What if the story woulda ended like this ? [/BAR] [BAR] I 'ma
kick it again but only with a slight twist [/BAR] [BAR] It goes one for the griot [/BAR] [BAR] Two
for da gods [/BAR] [BAR] Three to flip the script , cuz it ai n't that hard [/BAR] [BAR] Check
it out [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Time stood still as he thought to himself , [/BAR] [BAR] " This reminds
me of a beer commercial back in the day " [/BAR] [BAR] She 's too young to be her mother
[/BAR] [BAR] " Would you care to join in ? " [/BAR] [BAR] She was butt naked under her coat
[/BAR] [BAR] He was amazed at the second wind kickin' in [/BAR] [BAR] Thinkin' 'bout the fact that he almost
did n't go to the club [/BAR] [BAR] Woulda been wack [/BAR] [BAR] If he missed out on the greatest
love of his life [/BAR] [BAR] Imagine if he stayed home with his wife [/BAR] [BAR] Cuz girl two ,
[/BAR] [BAR] Yo her body made the 'tender look like a fender bender [/BAR] [BAR] The three of them together
turned the bed to a blender [/BAR] [BAR] He left like five hours later with a permanent ? ? ?
[/BAR] [BAR] And feels he will ever remember [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Talking ] [/BAR] [BAR] C 'mon J
, [/BAR] [BAR] There 's no way my man got laid quite like that [/BAR] [BAR] It just do n't
happen [/BAR] [BAR] It 's like a porno or somethin' [/BAR] [BAR] And what about his wife ? [/BAR] [BAR]
She did n't even say nothin' ? [/BAR] [BAR] She did n't page him ? [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [
Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Time stood still as he thought to himself , [/BAR] [BAR] " This reminds
me of a beer commercial back in the day " [/BAR] [BAR] She 's too young to be her mother
, so he asked , " How you doin' ? " [/BAR] [BAR] She said " Eww ! It smells
like somebody been screwin' ! [/BAR] [BAR] I hope it was n't y 'all " [/BAR] [BAR] Then she started
laughin' [/BAR] [BAR] He said " What 's so funny ? " [/BAR] [BAR] She said " You do n't
know the half " [/BAR] [BAR] She was starin' at the joint with a fucked-up smile [/BAR] [BAR] She said
" I can come back if you gon' be here for awhile [/BAR] [BAR] But between me and you ,
and my roommate too [/BAR] [BAR] What I 'm 'bout to say might just be a little snafu in your
plans [/BAR] [BAR] She used to be a dude ! " ( Yeah , how 's that for a plot
twist ) [/BAR] [BAR] He asked the 'tender was it true [/BAR] [BAR] She said " Shit , I told
you last night , my man , I thought you knew " [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Talking ] [/BAR]

Cause your baby been coughin' all day [/BAR] [BAR] And the daddy ai n't there and wo n't pay [/BAR]

[BAR] My mind speaks mathematics [/BAR] [BAR] Sometimes I feel english is a poor translation of my hearts palpations [/BAR]
[BAR] That 's why I give it to you quarter notes at a time [/BAR] [BAR] So that my rhymes
are aided by body gyrations [/BAR] [BAR] But now it 's like each hymn ai n't nothing but a word
with-- [/BAR] [BAR] Countless synonymns where should I begin with them ? [/BAR] [BAR] Every + sentence + is a
jail bid [/BAR] [BAR] locking me in to + bars + of meaning with so much space between them [/BAR]
[BAR] And it 's all real [/BAR] [BAR] If I took a little bit of time [/BAR] [BAR] to reflect
on the unreal my brain might peel off my mind [/BAR] [BAR] To reveal this pegasus spree well [/BAR] [BAR]
whole-sale fairytale echo in a conch shell [/BAR] [BAR] But why say it if you ca n't see it ?
[/BAR] [BAR] I can call it abstract and say take what you want from it [/BAR] [BAR] I could do
that all day till my tongue goes numb from it [/BAR] [BAR] but see what good will come from it
? [/BAR] [BAR] I got something to say , I ca n't run from it [/BAR] [BAR] I gotta confront
it . I ca n't watch while this . . . [/BAR] [BAR] Music that taught me so much as
a child [/BAR] [BAR] grows louder every day but the world grows dumb from it [/BAR] [BAR] So every line
that I draw from my pen [/BAR] [BAR] it shapes a letter that makes a word that feeds a verse
[/BAR] [BAR] A swim for home , a place for infinite styles [/BAR] [BAR] but it feels like 9000 miles

the same space in mind but now we in a different place at a different time [/BAR] [BAR] A different
taste to a different rhyme [/BAR] [BAR] with so many flavors to embrace , I ca n't waste a line

write , I get writers block [/BAR] [BAR] I get so stressed that I get dope rhymes from it ,
just to get rest [/BAR] [BAR] I get frustrated from this old world mess [/BAR] [BAR] So when I got
to get the bad air out my chest [/BAR] [BAR] I get on the mic and strive to be the

another one of those days , I [/BAR] [BAR] Had to admit it 's not easy being J-Live [/BAR] [BAR]
My bust this now , the topic to discuss is [/BAR] [BAR] It 's even harder sometimes just being justice
[/BAR] [BAR] J-Live 's just known to spin a record , spit a verse [/BAR] [BAR] Just as Allah 's
just God of the universe [/BAR] [BAR] Which means it 's civilized , righteous original man [/BAR] [BAR] With knowledge
of self and wisdom you can understand [/BAR] [BAR] Nothing less , nothing more , nothing holy , nothing pure
[/BAR] [BAR] Nothing gassed , just steadfast and sure [/BAR] [BAR] When something comes up , something goes wrong ,
something gets done [/BAR] [BAR] If there 's not a way my will will make one [/BAR] [BAR] My plans
are planets grown and made from the beginning [/BAR] [BAR] But now my game plan's going into extra innings [/BAR]
[BAR] But if it 's a game , that means somebody 's winnin' [/BAR] [BAR] And if it ai n't
me ? Nah , see , it 's gotta be [/BAR] [BAR] In this game of life , you score
with every breath [/BAR] [BAR] The idea 's to retire on your own terms [/BAR] [BAR] Never undefeated , just
with a winning record [/BAR] [BAR] So when it 's there after you 're gone , you 're still respected
[/BAR] [BAR] But now I gotta fall back , it 's a transition [/BAR] [BAR] It 's not a impossible
mission , but man listen [/BAR] [BAR] I ca n't say I 'm not struggling [/BAR] [BAR] Swingin' 9 planets
at the same time feels like juggling [/BAR] [BAR] Do n't get me wrong , and do n't get it
twisted [/BAR] [BAR] I was n't drafted into this life , I enlisted [/BAR] [BAR] Family , business , music
, it sweetens the pot [/BAR] [BAR] But what I need to know is . . . [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]
[BAR] ( Chorus ) [/BAR] [BAR] What do you do when you got [/BAR] [BAR] 20 2 minute tasks and
10 minutes to deal with it ? ( Ah man , forget it ) [/BAR] [BAR] What do you do
when you got [/BAR] [BAR] 20 2 minute tasks and 10 minutes to deal with it ? ( Should n'ta
bullshitted ) [/BAR] [BAR] What do you do when you got [/BAR] [BAR] 20 2 minute tasks and 10 minutes
to deal with it ? ( Stay committed ) [/BAR] [BAR] What do you do when you got [/BAR] [BAR]
20 2 minute tasks and 10 minutes to deal with it ? ( Just deal widit . . . )
[/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Just deal with it ( repeated and scratched ) [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] ( Verse 2
) [/BAR] [BAR] Sunset , sunrise , son time flies [/BAR] [BAR] But is it a fly ride or a

not fly by night , I 'm here to stay [/BAR] [BAR] I want a fly lifestyle with some fly
things [/BAR] [BAR] But I wo n't to the sun with wax wings [/BAR] [BAR] You 'll catch more flies
with honey than vinegar [/BAR] [BAR] But you better be prepared for the bee stings [/BAR] [BAR] Whether you 're
beehive climbin is 9-to-5 'in [/BAR] [BAR] Or rhymin' , it 's all about timin' [/BAR] [BAR] Time kills and
it do n't stand still [/BAR] [BAR] Those times where you just ca n't tell ? Well , time will
[/BAR] [BAR] That 's why I got no time to chill [/BAR] [BAR] I run late when I save things
for later [/BAR] [BAR] I deal with it , ill with it in the last minute [/BAR] [BAR] It 's
like I 'm some professional -crastinator ! [/BAR] [BAR] But I still ca n't let time swallow me [/BAR] [BAR]
Truth is , if I master equality [/BAR] [BAR] It 'll all add up in the end [/BAR] [BAR] But
I ca n't pretend these bad decisions do n't follow me [/BAR] [BAR] Sunrise , sunset , sun gets your
shit done [/BAR] [BAR] Deadlines take all the fun from . . . [/BAR] [BAR] Things that should n't even
feel like work [/BAR] [BAR] Now work your nerves cause time waits for no one ! [/BAR] [BAR] So it
's time that I own up to it [/BAR] [BAR] From time I wasted to time 's up , I
run to it [/BAR] [BAR] It 's not supposed to be easy bein' me [/BAR] [BAR] But I should n't
make it harder on myself when I gotta do it ! [/BAR] [BAR] So I 'm hard on myself so
I can go from sayin' [/BAR] [BAR] 'I 'm used to it ' to sayin 'I used to do it
' [/BAR] [BAR] But today as I 'm goin' through it [/BAR] [BAR] There 's only one thing left to
say . . . [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] ( Chorus ) [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Just deal with it (

rain , snow , hail , and thaw like , " Oh well " [/BAR] [BAR] Speed of light the
same , whether the sunshine [/BAR] [BAR] or blue flame , beware the butane [/BAR] [BAR] All 's well that

on who sane [/BAR] [BAR] But one thing for sure , somebody was not playin [/BAR] [BAR] If fate lets
you be , go ahead and be great [/BAR] [BAR] Cause greatness do n't care if somebody was not planned

was right on time [/BAR] [BAR] He was all up in the pocket , ridin the bassline [/BAR] [BAR] I
was impressed by the words he chose to rhyme [/BAR] [BAR] It was in divine design , similar to mine
[/BAR] [BAR] Like , " Man , why I never thought to use that before this ? " [/BAR] [BAR]
Really all in all , his rap style was flawless [/BAR] [BAR] But regardless , for some strange reason [/BAR]
[BAR] I was n't moved or compelled to laud or applaud this [/BAR] [BAR] Halfway through the song , I
'm already bored with [/BAR] [BAR] And I hate to sound so matter-of-fact [/BAR] [BAR] It was definitely dope ,
certainly not wack [/BAR] [BAR] But there was something that lacked , let me rewind the track [/BAR] [BAR] Listen
once , listen twice , listen three or four times [/BAR] [BAR] To the point , where I started to
memorize the lines [/BAR] [BAR] I finally realize yeah homeboy could spit [/BAR] [BAR] But it just did n't matter

with J-Live from your agenda [/BAR] [BAR] And remember that whoever lends a helpin hand to defend ya [/BAR] [BAR]
Will get burned to a cinder [/BAR] [BAR] As I end the , reign of wack MC 's with their
suicidal tendencies [/BAR] [BAR] Renderin me sick , with the thoughts of killin enemies [/BAR] [BAR] But then I return

till my name preceded by the great [/BAR] [BAR] I get around like digital Pac [/BAR] [BAR] And been around
like the ice cream truck on your block [/BAR] [BAR] And hold it down with a squirt gun deep in
your sink [/BAR] [BAR] Spittin around tight wisdom making you think [/BAR] [BAR] If you around light sweetheart you can
reflect [/BAR] [BAR] Do n't put it down cause you need art you can respect [/BAR] [BAR] I know it

you predict this mist you can hardly detect [/BAR] [BAR] Will draw you up plus six then you stand correct
[/BAR] [BAR] Lost and found no joke if you sleep or neglect [/BAR] [BAR] Then suck a dick till it
's poking out the back of your neck [/BAR] [BAR] Now bring it in [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Chorus [/BAR]
[BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] I heard nice guys finish last [/BAR] [BAR] But see this theory does n't quite explain the
reason I 'm [/BAR] [BAR] Letting y 'all rat racers leave the gate ahead of time [/BAR] [BAR] And still
politely waiting for you at the finish line [/BAR] [BAR] Some people find it so amazing how I put a
rhyme [/BAR] [BAR] Together and bring it to life like Dr. Frankenstein [/BAR] [BAR] I hope you can handle the
truth cause see I 'm frank with mine [/BAR] [BAR] So it be seeming like I 'm actin kinda stank
at times [/BAR] [BAR] But see my lines are built for battle like a tank design [/BAR] [BAR] Runnin through
obstacles like popeye through spinach time [/BAR] [BAR] I got some rules and regulations to diminish crime [/BAR] [BAR] And
if you follow em you could become a friend of mine [/BAR] [BAR] Some catch amnesia with their lyrics and
remember mine [/BAR] [BAR] Then they forget that it 's a tool I use to speak my mind [/BAR] [BAR]
But then they even got the nerve to try to freak my rhymes [/BAR] [BAR] But they get ate like
they was paint and I was turpentine [/BAR] [BAR] Now bring it in [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Chorus [/BAR] [BAR]
[/BAR] [BAR] It 's been a long time going [/BAR] [BAR] But you still got a bounce in your neck
[/BAR] [BAR] Till your problems feel neglect [/BAR] [BAR] It 's incorrect if you still detect all of the stress
[/BAR] [BAR] From the folks that expect to divide your check [/BAR] [BAR] See that 's the shit that be
making you think [/BAR] [BAR] Soon as your ship comes in you 'll be ready to sink [/BAR] [BAR] The
mind state got some scared of leaving their block [/BAR] [BAR] Phobiatic they 'll be going out like Biggie and
Pac [/BAR] [BAR] Now meanwhile some will swing it and it come out great [/BAR] [BAR] Find a shorty give
you wop till you ca n't see straight [/BAR] [BAR] Tell her bounce in the morning she wo n't even

alone now he feel irate [/BAR] [BAR] Trying to front upon the style that the Live create [/BAR] [BAR] You
hear the same word twice and wanna file a complaint [/BAR] [BAR] Well check the order of the line that
'll set things straight [/BAR] [BAR] Now bring it in [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Chorus [/BAR] [BAR] [ * *
scratched * * ] [/BAR] [BAR] " What does it take " [/BAR] [BAR] " to be a great "
[/BAR] [BAR] " MC " [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] If you ask me , it 's much more than Master
of Ceremonies [/BAR] [BAR] Because a lot of Masquerading Cornballs [/BAR] [BAR] Do n't realize it also means Mad Creativity
[/BAR] [BAR] In this day and age of mediocrity [/BAR] [BAR] There 's two types of rappers that you 'll
recognize and hear [/BAR] [BAR] But I prefer the ones with the lyrics of the year [/BAR] [BAR] Than the
gimmick with the gear and the right puppeteer [/BAR] [BAR] Now you can be the next rock ? ? Shakespear
[/BAR] [BAR] you 're still 10 steps away from having a career [/BAR] [BAR] You step up the plate to
earn respect from your peers [/BAR] [BAR] And end up on deck for the remainder of your years [/BAR] [BAR]
I suppose this means greatness takes blood , sweat , and tears [/BAR] [BAR] It also takes an industry that
does n't breed fear [/BAR] [BAR] Or pumping all this mindless crap up in your ears [/BAR] [BAR] And ?
? in the contrast of what you get to hear [/BAR] [BAR] You got to recognize it 's a determined
idea [/BAR] [BAR] A righteous young mind is a devil 's worst fear [/BAR] [BAR] But when you wanna give
the people peace and satisfaction [/BAR] [BAR] Everybody 's mama wants a piece of the action [/BAR] [BAR] So now
I fall victim to supply and demand [/BAR] [BAR] Immaculate conceptions , born illegitimate [/BAR] [BAR] Destined to be the
greatest story ever missed [/BAR] [BAR] Which means its meant to be for whoever 's hearing this [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]
[BAR] [ Chorus 2x ] [/BAR] [BAR] When it 's all said and done it should be heard and seen
[/BAR] [BAR] 'Til this cold-hearted game forces us to change teams [/BAR] [BAR] While the lust for the loot spreads
out like gangrene [/BAR] [BAR] So the haves chase their tails while the nots chase their dreams [/BAR] [BAR] As
the years chase the days , past the futures , meet fate [/BAR] [BAR] Like your firstborn , waiting for
pop 's release date [/BAR] [BAR] Postpone , meanwhile , I accumulate means [/BAR] [BAR] To revise and renew what
was just heard and seen [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] It 's been stated that I rhyme like God and I
? ? like a poet [/BAR] [BAR] One hand ? ? the other like Lady Macbeth [/BAR] [BAR] Flip styles
like Bela Karolyi [/BAR] [BAR] Warm hearted , cold blooded [/BAR] [BAR] I write like opposite left [/BAR] [BAR] I
left opposites right what they left off [/BAR] [BAR] My rights left right-wing as left to right beside me [/BAR]
[BAR] Left my right hand man 'cause he left what 's right [/BAR] [BAR] And I reserve the right to
write 'til I 'm free [/BAR] [BAR] 'Cause I free styles with my pen , [/BAR] [BAR] That ya 'll
could n't if you freestyled all day long [/BAR] [BAR] Literally , this literature designed for one orator [/BAR] [BAR]
Stays on the head [/BAR] [BAR] Emcee 's emcee , that I be the emcee 's emcee [/BAR] [BAR] 'Cause
I am saying what I am thinking [/BAR] [BAR] Except when my mind 's blinking [/BAR] [BAR] My eyes open
even when my eyes ' drinking [/BAR] [BAR] I 's a socializer , but more so with those wiser [/BAR]
[BAR] Ask yourself why 's a music so misused it 's self contained [/BAR] [BAR] And not self sustained [/BAR]
[BAR] I myself contemplate this 'til I make myself complain [/BAR] [BAR] Shall my raps stay maintained , wrapped in
cellophane [/BAR] [BAR] 'Til they 're unwrapped by human consumers ? [/BAR] [BAR] Emphatically no , so I rap wherever
I go [/BAR] [BAR] And let it grow up in your brain like a tumor [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [
Chorus 2x ] [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Aiiyo , ya think ya really know me well [/BAR] [BAR] There 's
more to me than ya mind got room for [/BAR] [BAR] And much much more than a clever verse or
two [/BAR] [BAR] That 's all you know about me , you ai n't even knowing that [/BAR] [BAR] You
think I give a fuck whether or not my record sells ? [/BAR] [BAR] You 're damn right but you
see that ai n't the way I 'm keeping score [/BAR] [BAR] If one million people said it does that
make it true [/BAR] [BAR] You judge my music by whether or not my pocket 's fat ? [/BAR] [BAR]
Well , fuck you [/BAR] [BAR] When the cash cow you 're milking [/BAR] [BAR] It ai n't yours but
the job pays well , do n't it ? [/BAR] [BAR] And if you 're lucky you can even get
to taste a drop [/BAR] [BAR] We 'll see who 's happy when you 're old but you 're not
grown [/BAR] [BAR] You see me ? Now , yeah , you 'll see me later too [/BAR] [BAR] Fucking
you up when the vantage point change , do n't it ? [/BAR] [BAR] I know what 's hip ,
but you determine if it 's hop or pop [/BAR] [BAR] You 're just a man without a voice ,
pass the microphone [/BAR] [BAR] I know the diff between written rhymes and freestyles [/BAR] [BAR] You see , for
me , it 's like having sex or making love [/BAR] [BAR] And you should know by now I 'm
married to the pad and pen [/BAR] [BAR] But I 'm entitled to cheat on her every now and then
[/BAR] [BAR] Will your children know the hip hop history ? [/BAR] [BAR] Will the songs you hate be shrouded
in mystery ? [/BAR] [BAR] Do n't step to me with your stats and your date smarts [/BAR] [BAR] You
know your neighborhood by street signs or landmarks ? [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm not talking 'bout the first record ever
made [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm talking 'bout the first one that ever made you [/BAR] [BAR] The first records that
I played never played me [/BAR] [BAR] And I can still play 'em today 'cause they stay true [/BAR] [BAR]
You know this time I 'm only speaking on the timeless [/BAR] [BAR] It makes sense now and then ,
yeah , now and then [/BAR] [BAR] 'Cause now it 's making picture perfect sense and then [/BAR] [BAR] It
's making picture perfect sense like it did now [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus 4x ] [/BAR] [BAR] *
send corrections to the typist [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Let me tell you about the time I had to solve
this case [/BAR] [BAR] When some crab motherfucker straight invaded my space [/BAR] [BAR] It was approximately 8 : 47
P . M . [/BAR] [BAR] I was on my way home comin' back from the gym [/BAR] [BAR] My
muscles kinda ached , they felt rigid and stiff [/BAR] [BAR] But my mind was at ease from this Coltrane
riff [/BAR] [BAR] Playin loud . . . out at Fulton and Truce [/BAR] [BAR] Till a Jeep drowned it
out with Xzibit and Snoop [/BAR] [BAR] As I get closer to the heezy baby [/BAR] [BAR] Certain parts of
my body started actin' crazy [/BAR] [BAR] My ears got to twitchin' and my right hand shook [/BAR] [BAR] I
had the sudden need to speed so I decided to book [/BAR] [BAR] As I arrived on the block to
see a bunch of kids scopin' out my building [/BAR] [BAR] Noticin' the door wide open [/BAR] [BAR] As I
jetted up the stairs past signs of forced entry [/BAR] [BAR] Expecting to see my humble abode stripped empty [/BAR]
[BAR] Oh hell no ! [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] ( ah , ah , ah , ah , ) X8
[/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Ay yo , my trip from the front door to the second floor [/BAR] [BAR] Had
me feelin' so alone , embarrassed and insecure [/BAR] [BAR] My worldly possessions that I cherished in pride [/BAR] [BAR]
Flashed in a matter of seconds before my eyes [/BAR] [BAR] But not photographic , more like alphanumeric [/BAR] [BAR]
You know , VCR , TV , laptop , C3 [/BAR] [BAR] VS , MP , LP , CDs [/BAR]
[BAR] RL , ( ? ) , N-I-K-E [/BAR] [BAR] Not to mention USA and RC3C [/BAR] [BAR] That opened
up in D . C . for Run DMC ( ? ) [/BAR] [BAR] This has gotta be a nightmare
, somebody pinch me [/BAR] [BAR] When up the stairs I see my ten-speed GT [/BAR] [BAR] Right where I
left it , rather bizarre [/BAR] [BAR] Still felt violated , my apartment door was ajar [/BAR] [BAR] As I
stormed in , thinkin' it 's about to be on [/BAR] [BAR] The window was wide open , but nothin'
was gone [/BAR] [BAR] As I dashed to the edge I held my head past the ledge [/BAR] [BAR] I
seen two hooded figures jumpin' over a fence [/BAR] [BAR] They was way beyond capture , so I took a
step back [/BAR] [BAR] So I could figure this shit out cuz it was getting intense [/BAR] [BAR] The computer
was on , file cabinets wide open [/BAR] [BAR] Bookshelves was tipped over , they searched , but did n't
steal [/BAR] [BAR] Wait a minute , the picture from my built-in safe [/BAR] [BAR] Was slightly tilted to the
side , I was beginning to feel [/BAR] [BAR] The same tingling in my fingers and hands [/BAR] [BAR] Everything
else in the house was there , so work with me one time [/BAR] [BAR] But my instincts failed me
not [/BAR] [BAR] The safe was blown wide open [/BAR] [BAR] They stole my priceless book of rhymes ! [/BAR]
[BAR] Oh hell no ! [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] ( ah , ah , ah , ah ) [/BAR] [BAR]

got it ? They ca n't have it [/BAR] [BAR] Dagnabit ! The last thing I needed was static [/BAR]
[BAR] But I got a briefcase for just such an occasion [/BAR] [BAR] So I grabbed it , jetted downstairs
, hailed a cab [/BAR] [BAR] I knew this shit was gonna happen , I was gettin' too nice [/BAR]
[BAR] From the briefcase I pulled out a homin' device [/BAR] [BAR] Three times better than lowjack , these MC
's is so whack [/BAR] [BAR] That now they gotta resort to stealin' my text [/BAR] [BAR] As I fixed
on their position for my intercept mission [/BAR] [BAR] The cabbie was feather-footed , it was getting me vexed [/BAR]
[BAR] As we headed toward Jersey the signal got stronger [/BAR] [BAR] Even in the tunnel was right on they
tail [/BAR] [BAR] A green Volkswagen had the nerve to blast ragged [/BAR] [BAR] A dead giveaway , now watch
justice prevail [/BAR] [BAR] I told the cabbie get closer , but he had no heart [/BAR] [BAR] Next thing
I know we was like five blocks apart [/BAR] [BAR] But they was headed for the airport , a getaway
plan [/BAR] [BAR] Traffic was getting ' thick , so I got out and ran [/BAR] [BAR] Followed the signal
all the way to this drive in hanger [/BAR] [BAR] These niggas wanna . . . with a lear jet

in time , but I 'm not done yet [/BAR] [BAR] So watch this [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] You think

verse 1 - The Third Eye ] [/BAR] [BAR] For the first third [/BAR] [BAR] I had to borrow three
words from Stevie for the issue [/BAR] [BAR] For what it 's worth I 'm calling this official [/BAR] [BAR]
To live and die for you is to live and die with you [/BAR] [BAR] If what we got ai
n't superficial or artificial [/BAR] [BAR] I feel at home with you if I share my dome with you [/BAR]
[BAR] Develop your mind to understand mine and grow with you [/BAR] [BAR] It 's hypothetical I have yet to
meet you [/BAR] [BAR] But all it takes is time well spent alone with you [/BAR] [BAR] ? ? could
move along to reach the 8th rank [/BAR] [BAR] To resurrect with the grace of a queen she will receive
and reflect [/BAR] [BAR] Knowing just what I mean when I claim that I protect my useful land [/BAR] [BAR]
like the fearless grown man that I am [/BAR] [BAR] With the plan to expand it 's painstakin' [/BAR] [BAR]
Like feedin' food for thought and regulatin' mental bakin' [/BAR] [BAR] Correcting each other when we 're mistaken and debatin'
[/BAR] [BAR] Turns to arguing but other ? ? leads to the best earthquakin' [/BAR] [BAR] But still in all
I needs no reminder [/BAR] [BAR] that God will be the maker and owner but not the finder [/BAR] [BAR]
So in this wilderness I will reserve the Best Part [/BAR] [BAR] For each queen I meet I make it
known from the start [/BAR] [BAR] When I tell ya like this . . . . . [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]
[BAR] ( Chorus w/ same background scratching as the intro ) [/BAR] [BAR] " You can get the third ;

The Third Leg ] [/BAR] [BAR] I set the speed in which you twist upon ya axis [/BAR] [BAR] From
changing ya thoughts to turnin' over on the mattress [/BAR] [BAR] The fact is the culture that I practice [/BAR]
[BAR] prescribes me the father of the civil so most muthafuckas lack this [/BAR] [BAR] More often than not the
type of woman I attract is [/BAR] [BAR] lookin' to discover just another piece of steel [/BAR] [BAR] And you
can test my heart ? ? [/BAR] [BAR] but see I ca n't be trapped by my magnetic field [/BAR]
[BAR] To bring it down to earth I 'm talking bout your sex appeal [/BAR] [BAR] You 've got the
good ? ? and yes you know I know tha deal [/BAR] [BAR] Not even too concerned on who 's
the last and next to feel [/BAR] [BAR] cuz the sword that a weild sports a lubricated shield [/BAR] [BAR]
The only problem is you never take the time to build [/BAR] [BAR] and then you 've got the nerve
to say I treat you like a freak ? ! [/BAR] [BAR] I try to chill and conversate with you
but ? ? do n't stop [/BAR] [BAR] and that 's my spot yo we hardly even speak [/BAR] [BAR]
So get to know the mind behind the dick that I 'm slingin' [/BAR] [BAR] Next time when I 'm
done yo try not to fall asleep [/BAR] [BAR] But still in all I really ca n't complain about ya
" brain " [/BAR] [BAR] cuz you 're the first on my mind when the time comes to creep [/BAR]

up on girls like the first two [/BAR] [BAR] but instead I was wasting time fuckin' with you ! [/BAR]
[BAR] On some bottom line shit I know I played myself in retrospect [/BAR] [BAR] Givin' you the respect of
a top choice select [/BAR] [BAR] On some " never again shit " I expect [/BAR] [BAR] I chalk it
up to trial and error but I ca n't say I 'm over it yet [/BAR] [BAR] Out of sight
mind and body could 've sworn you were the best of both worlds [/BAR] [BAR] in my eyes yo ,
you had no flaws [/BAR] [BAR] Then I learned it was to good to be true [/BAR] [BAR] so now
my two favorite records are " Wildflower " & " Truly Yours " [/BAR] [BAR] I ca n't front though

[BAR] Truth was seen but not heard you was lyin' for days [/BAR] [BAR] just to find yourself lost in
your own damn age [/BAR] [BAR] Now my vision's clarified like Windex [/BAR] [BAR] you get the peace sign without
the index [/BAR] [BAR] From ex to next--too complex ? [/BAR] [BAR] I 'll translate : FUCK YOU [/BAR] [BAR]
clean bill of health still I wish I never stuck you [/BAR] [BAR] Claim to be my Earth but you
too trife [/BAR] [BAR] more like Mercury you came close but too hot to sustain life [/BAR] [BAR] So now
ya cast out far out like Pluto [/BAR] [BAR] three strikes through ? ? but the choosen few [/BAR] [BAR]

when my record was born [/BAR] [BAR] And how I played my favorite classics till the needles was gone [/BAR]
[BAR] And truth say , you might know how my moms pushed in '76 [/BAR] [BAR] Turned my world view
inside out and one day [/BAR] [BAR] But this goes back further than that , further than rap [/BAR] [BAR]
Before that first hospital slap [/BAR] [BAR] Way beyond the confines of joy and pain [/BAR] [BAR] Further than pride
and shame [/BAR] [BAR] Older than the foundation of the food chain [/BAR] [BAR] To bore the understanding of an
equal cypher [/BAR] [BAR] With the consistency of daylight , I shine so bright [/BAR] [BAR] I check 1 ,
2 but I ai n't talking about no mic [/BAR] [BAR] I check 1 , 2 and calculate the science
of life [/BAR] [BAR] To add things right and take care of my business [/BAR] [BAR] Allowing me to handle
my pleasure like a pirate does treasure [/BAR] [BAR] My rhymes are burried too deep to measure by the sands

it wo n't go away [/BAR] [BAR] I keep it timeless because I do my thing [/BAR] [BAR] Regardless of

deal with it [/BAR] [BAR] And for the first 5 you bullshitted [/BAR] [BAR] The scenario really best describes our
folks [/BAR] [BAR] Its like devils got plans and niggaz got jokes [/BAR] [BAR] Like an underdog team got hopes
, but [/BAR] [BAR] Hoop dream buzzer-beaters choke when y 'all triple team pointguards go nuts [/BAR] [BAR] Power corrupts

guts [/BAR] [BAR] And high scorers check stats but they still have yet to win [/BAR] [BAR] Plus tomorrow they
'll be riding the bench once again , you see [/BAR] [BAR] In this game I 'm not trying to
be the M . V . P [/BAR] [BAR] Cuz the enemy 's the clock and the referee [/BAR] [BAR]

words [/BAR] [BAR] Only to find out your visions is blurred [/BAR] [BAR] Its absurd but still I observe [/BAR]
[BAR] How the brilliance of Blackness is missed when a sights unheard [/BAR] [BAR] As old rhyme styles fester like
dreams deferred [/BAR] [BAR] New styles just might shine at God 's speed indeed [/BAR] [BAR] But some still wear
the mask that grins and lies [/BAR] [BAR] Hides cheeks and shades eyes but I 'm not suprised [/BAR] [BAR]
It 's no disguise cuz my five eyes remain all wise [/BAR] [BAR] No excuse cuz the innocent is still
down south , no escape [/BAR] [BAR] We remain robbed , killed and raped [/BAR] [BAR] Till you take back
your mind and extract the lies [/BAR] [BAR] But until then , I still utilize my pen [/BAR] [BAR] To
lead the land from the slaughter and a horse to the water [/BAR] [BAR] Continuing the face the stress of
lifes test [/BAR] [BAR] With rhymes that impress the best cuz my mind is timeless [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] (
Hook ) [/BAR] [BAR] Check , turn up my mic a little [/BAR] [BAR] Yeah , a little more ,
I gotta be kinda low on this one [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Yo , as I start from scratch about
this born suspect named Nic [/BAR] [BAR] A street legend , pulling hits was his infatuation [/BAR] [BAR] >From birth
his first spoken word was " Tech " [/BAR] [BAR] So by the age of 12 you could guess what
would dominate his conversation [/BAR] [BAR] He had a twin brother borns in the part [/BAR] [BAR] One was dark
, one was light , neither was right [/BAR] [BAR] Taking turns letting off shots to move crowds [/BAR] [BAR]
With the needlepoint aim and the infrared sights so they ruled the night [/BAR] [BAR] His tone arm stayed tipped
with the nickle-plated [/BAR] [BAR] So even in the crossfire they were never faded [/BAR] [BAR] It was debated but
the still play was overrated [/BAR] [BAR] But they negated all competitors that tried to state it [/BAR] [BAR] Very
few crossed the line and made it [/BAR] [BAR] Without a scratch , for every new batch there was a
new catch [/BAR] [BAR] Often , people asked Nic why his revolver would n't stop [/BAR] [BAR] He replied "
Everybody wants me in the coffin " [/BAR] [BAR] His pitch ass tried to get live at a red light
[/BAR] [BAR] He received 33 from a 45 [/BAR] [BAR] By the green light , the change in his heartbeat
tempo [/BAR] [BAR] Proved to Nic that nobody was exempt [/BAR] [BAR] So , he took his game from the
PJ centers [/BAR] [BAR] To the clubs , constantly getting caught up in the mix [/BAR] [BAR] Slipping through the
fingers of the system [/BAR] [BAR] Waiting in the cut to see who 'll be the next man to try
and diss him [/BAR] [BAR] Til one day , Nic was playing sniper again [/BAR] [BAR] Quiet but deadly ,
picking off his prey from the roof when [/BAR] [BAR] All of the sudden he had the illest vision [/BAR]
[BAR] It got him amped , he stood up straight and started woofing [/BAR] [BAR] His twin bro simply had
no idea [/BAR] [BAR] That the killer Nic was reevaluating his career [/BAR] [BAR] When his thought process made him
defiant [/BAR] [BAR] Equilizing similar victims from one major client [/BAR] [BAR] The concept hit him in a Flash [/BAR]
[BAR] There was much more to this lifestyle led than petty cash [/BAR] [BAR] But his brother just could n't
understand [/BAR] [BAR] That every move they made was planned by the unseen hand [/BAR] [BAR] So Nic flipped the
script from the new to next school [/BAR] [BAR] Transformed the game and rearranged the rules [/BAR] [BAR] Self-employed ,
but quest made a transition [/BAR] [BAR] Cornered the market by taking out your competition [/BAR] [BAR] Well Nic 's
brother did n't have the same ambition [/BAR] [BAR] He 'd rather catch his victim than his fellow suspects [/BAR]
[BAR] But he agreed something had to change so as they discussed this [/BAR] [BAR] He realized his life like
" Poetic Justice " [/BAR] [BAR] So Nic 's right hand man broke left [/BAR] [BAR] To become one of
the well-known 5 Fingers of Death [/BAR] [BAR] Similar ends with new means and motivation [/BAR] [BAR] Cause now it
's volunteer work to vent his frustration [/BAR] [BAR] They both grew with time and skills became refined [/BAR] [BAR]
At once saw it 's essential to read between the lines [/BAR] [BAR] They both like to see their prey
dead [/BAR] [BAR] But one was addicted , to seeing a pale body filled with lead [/BAR] [BAR] See Nic
's brother had a signature move [/BAR] [BAR] So folks would know he was the one out to get 'em
[/BAR] [BAR] It 's like he pulled the trigger to the rhythm [/BAR] [BAR] Just to make you think that
your fate , [/BAR] [BAR] was signed and sealed in permanent ink [/BAR] [BAR] And do n't let the motive
be anything more than cold-blooded [/BAR] [BAR] Cause then he 'll put two times the effort in the caper [/BAR]
[BAR] When diamond-tipped shells will drop jewels in your dome [/BAR] [BAR] Pull out your heart , and wrap it
up in wax paper [/BAR] [BAR] It goes one for you , one for me [/BAR] [BAR] Two for you
, one two for me [/BAR] [BAR] Three for you , one two three for me [/BAR] [BAR] Four for

Shut your trap [/BAR] [BAR] I heard you got a jones for keeping up with the Joneses [/BAR] [BAR] The
only problem is , all your Jones is wack [/BAR] [BAR] This kid tried to tell me you the bomb
( Word to mother ) [/BAR] [BAR] Come to find out , he on your streets he want to cover
[/BAR] [BAR] Well if that ai n't debacle in the ghetto for the sea party [/BAR] [BAR] Smooth move ,
Ex-Lax , who said you ai n't shit ? [/BAR] [BAR] You need to come to grips with the fact
that you 're slipping [/BAR] [BAR] Shooting off the mouth but forgot to put your clip in [/BAR] [BAR] Meanwhile
somewhere on the Eastside of side pat [/BAR] [BAR] Truly yours plotting like Nikki and the Brain [/BAR] [BAR] They
have it both ways with the lying shin point [/BAR] [BAR] So show forth and prove who 's the master
in the game [/BAR] [BAR] That 's why it goes [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] One for you , one for

your voice [/BAR] [BAR] So new jacks feel the sad truth [/BAR] [BAR] Nobody wants the puddin till they taste
the proof [/BAR] [BAR] Now you could have the best beat and the illest flow [/BAR] [BAR] A dope crew

VERSE 3 ] [/BAR] [BAR] So let 's see , as we break this down logically [/BAR] [BAR] On bleak
and firm premises , the crowd wants to murder ya [/BAR] [BAR] Because they never heard of ya [/BAR] [BAR]
But do you quit it , wishin you never woulda did it [/BAR] [BAR] Or stay committted , and come
with it ? [/BAR] [BAR] Well , I prefer the latter , cause time flies [/BAR] [BAR] And if you
're dope , you get a deal and watch your pockets get fatter [/BAR] [BAR] And even if you 're
wack you 'll probably get a deal anyway [/BAR] [BAR] Cause nowadays , come on , look around : it
do n't matter [/BAR] [BAR] Besides , what 's your option ? Put your hard work up for adaption ?
[/BAR] [BAR] And climb back down from the middle of the ladder ? [/BAR] [BAR] I rather break the mics
and the lights [/BAR] [BAR] And lick a shot up in the air just to watch the crowd scatter [/BAR]
[BAR] But nah , cause then you mess it up for the few true [/BAR] [BAR] Hardcore heads that give
credit where the credit is due [/BAR] [BAR] Guaranteed that if you keep it dedicated to them [/BAR] [BAR] They
'll turn around and dedicate it to you [/BAR] [BAR] Like yo [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ CHORUS ] [/BAR]
[BAR] [ Malcolm X ] [/BAR] [BAR] " The police the same way ; they put their club upside your
head [/BAR] [BAR] and turn around and accuse YOU of attacking them . [/BAR] [BAR] Every case of police brutality
against a Negro follows the same pattern . . . " [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ J-Live ] [/BAR] [BAR]
I tell you what , I pledge allegiance to the people not the flag [/BAR] [BAR] The flag 'll never
represent the people 'til we all considered equal [/BAR] [BAR] In the eyes of the law , rich or poor
, officers kill [/BAR] [BAR] blacks with no remorse , then ask what we bitchin for [/BAR] [BAR] And wonder
why the innocent ai n't even snitchin for 'em [/BAR] [BAR] You just as dangerous as criminals , so pick
your poison [/BAR] [BAR] Part of the problem that refuses to relate [/BAR] [BAR] Turn the hood to a trap
, very few can escape [/BAR] [BAR] Like the Word that precedes it - neighbor [/BAR] [BAR] But if it
ai n't the cops , it 's somebody else 's neighborhood watch [/BAR] [BAR] As the money turns your block
from hot to the new hot spot [/BAR] [BAR] Now it 's someone else 's neighborhood , watch how police
get along with them [/BAR] [BAR] The storm troopers think the whole hood is truant unless it 's affluent [/BAR]
[BAR] But even if you 're fluent in the language of law [/BAR] [BAR] with stacks of green backs ,
you ca n't reply or buy out [/BAR] [BAR] the fact if you black , there 's a target on
your back [/BAR] [BAR] Your front , your side , they 'll blow down your front door [/BAR] [BAR] Where
you reside , air out your ride [/BAR] [BAR] Whether hooptie or coupe , your hoodie or your suit [/BAR]
[BAR] You 're ugly or you 're cute , a dentist or his son with a [/BAR] [BAR] scholarship to
hoop , Colin Powell or Snoop [/BAR] [BAR] Hands on the steering wheel , thrown for a loop [/BAR] [BAR]
Hands up , wallet out , screaming , " Do n't shoot ! " [/BAR] [BAR] Without even so much
as an oops [/BAR] [BAR] Armed to the teeth like troops , fully automatic [/BAR] [BAR] Patrolling the warzone that
we call home [/BAR] [BAR] Unless I 'm breaking the law , leave me the fuck alone ! ! [/BAR]
[BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Huey P . Newton ] [/BAR] [BAR] " In America , black people are treated very
much as the Vietnamese people [/BAR] [BAR] or any other colonized people because we 're used , we 're brutalized
[/BAR] [BAR] The police in our community occupy our area - our community [/BAR] [BAR] as the foreign troops occupy
territory [/BAR] [BAR] And the police , they are not to - in our community - [/BAR] [BAR] are not
to promote our welfare or our security , our safety [/BAR] [BAR] but they are there to contain us ,
to brutalize us , to murder us [/BAR] [BAR] because they have their orders to do so " [/BAR] [BAR]
[/BAR] [BAR] [ J-Live ] [/BAR] [BAR] How you gonna serve and protect [/BAR] [BAR] a beat on a street
that you do n't even respect ? [/BAR] [BAR] Blaming the neglect on the neglected [/BAR] [BAR] Confounding the cause
for the effected [/BAR] [BAR] Children , women and men subjected [/BAR] [BAR] to a stop and frisk puts pride
and lives at risk [/BAR] [BAR] Heartbeats on pause , if not stop [/BAR] [BAR] And probable cause is probably
cause we black and y 'all cops [/BAR] [BAR] No apologies , but apologists say not all police - Shh
. . . Please ! [/BAR] [BAR] When you 're treated less than human by a beast [/BAR] [BAR] It
does n't matter if it 's the whole beast or nothing but the beast [/BAR] [BAR] If it 's systemic
, pandemic [/BAR] [BAR] and you do n't even have the decency to condemn it ? Goddamn it ! [/BAR]
[BAR] Good constable , if I was hiding [/BAR] [BAR] behind the same shield I should feel responsible [/BAR] [BAR]
But when a black child of God is dead [/BAR] [BAR] and you 're dead wrong , why you only
able to respond [/BAR] [BAR] defensive for beating the defenseless senseless ? [/BAR] [BAR] When we mourn and protest ,
pursuit is relentless [/BAR] [BAR] But what about pursuit of justice ? What happened to the [/BAR] [BAR] People verses
? When it’s police verses people like US [/BAR] [BAR] Victims are discussed with disdain [/BAR] [BAR] and disgust ,
fear , hate and distrust [/BAR] [BAR] Hard to win hearts and minds [/BAR] [BAR] when you lose 'em and
you break 'em at the same damn time [/BAR] [BAR] How many hearts and minds and bodies are confined [/BAR]
[BAR] just for being indicted of the same exact crime ? [/BAR] [BAR] But ca n't afford the kind of
defense that 's unionized [/BAR] [BAR] Weaponized and never repents , the standards [/BAR] [BAR] are doubled like sentences [/BAR]
[BAR] Like what the 4th 8th and 13th Amendment is ? [/BAR] [BAR] Did you forget ? Cause the facts
do n't add up to the stats [/BAR] [BAR] When the deck and dice and the dealer is loaded and
stacked [/BAR] [BAR] So when I say I am a black man [/BAR] [BAR] or simply I am a man
, you had me at black [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Huey P . Newton ] [/BAR] [BAR] " The
police in our community could n't possibly be there [/BAR] [BAR] to protect our property because we own no property
[/BAR] [BAR] They could n't possibly be there to see that we receive the due process [/BAR] [BAR] of law
for the simple reason that the police themselves deny us [/BAR] [BAR] the due process of law , so it
's very apparent that the police only [/BAR] [BAR] in our community are not for our security , but the
security [/BAR] [BAR] of the business owners in the community and also to see [/BAR] [BAR] that the status quo
is kept in tact " [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Malcolm X ] [/BAR] [BAR] " They attack the victim
and then the CRIMINAL who ATTACKED [/BAR] [BAR] the victim accuses the victim of attacking him [/BAR] [BAR] This is

, the nickname , Big Bertha [/BAR] [BAR] It 's probably the kid that half the crews have never hearda
[/BAR] [BAR] whose mind travels further [/BAR] [BAR] than sex , drugs , and murder [/BAR] [BAR] so when you
play the role of the timeless inserter [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm sorry if you 're 85 and you would have
preferred a [/BAR] [BAR] album full of ignorance [/BAR] [BAR] the place is an experience [/BAR] [BAR] before the reasons
why [/BAR] [BAR] for the sake of sounding fly , but I [/BAR] [BAR] grade your style without the curve
[/BAR] [BAR] Cause you do n't deserve to [/BAR] [BAR] receive the grade that might let you build up the
nerve to [/BAR] [BAR] bite the rhyme that feeds you [/BAR] [BAR] I need you to listen [/BAR] [BAR] my
words are whet with crystal-clear wisdom so they glisten [/BAR] [BAR] and I fill in the blanks for all the
answers that you 're missing [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm rolling with the mongoose , cause snakes is steady hissing [/BAR]
[BAR] to expose my flaws like salt in sores [/BAR] [BAR] since they cannot be reformed I simply kill 'em

with the mic is like a chef with a blade [/BAR] [BAR] no doubt [/BAR] [BAR] man I cut ya
like lumber [/BAR] [BAR] ( repeat ) [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] you see somewhere in between the old school and
the new school [/BAR] [BAR] a master of the next school [/BAR] [BAR] came to teach the now school [/BAR]
[BAR] Cause business class was steady playing old tricks on new fools [/BAR] [BAR] so everybody rocks jewels , but
ca n't nobody drop jewels [/BAR] [BAR] one-track-minded , blinded , thinking only pop 's cool [/BAR] [BAR] supply &
demand rules , replaced by A&R rules [/BAR] [BAR] a scholar of the next school [/BAR] [BAR] who was n't
trying to hear that [/BAR] [BAR] so principals and teachers abroad began to fear that [/BAR] [BAR] " If this
guy makes an impact on the students that we play , [/BAR] [BAR] they 'll end up having way too
much control over their grades ! " [/BAR] [BAR] see grades will equal status for power , so just like
college [/BAR] [BAR] you 're so caught up in letter grades , you skip the 'F 'ing knowledge [/BAR] [BAR]
See that 's how music knowledge switch from listener to maker [/BAR] [BAR] And that 's why music maker switch
from listener to faker [/BAR] [BAR] so when the listener graduates to be an artist [/BAR] [BAR] you still enslaved
by the principles because they 're heartless [/BAR] [BAR] first they make you imitate another man's skill [/BAR] [BAR] now
you use your power for another man's will [/BAR] [BAR] move the crowd 's mental when they tell you sit
still [/BAR] [BAR] move the crowds pockets instead to get the bread [/BAR] [BAR] yeah that 's what the students
gather from what the principal said [/BAR] [BAR] they make you think the world bleeds green instead of read [/BAR]
[BAR] but class is in session now so all that stuff is dead [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm coming through with
knowledge and wisdom to fill your head [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Chorus : [/BAR] [BAR] J-Live with the mic is
like a chef with a blade [/BAR] [BAR] no doubt [/BAR] [BAR] man I cut ya like lumber [/BAR] [BAR]
( repeat X 3 ) [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] " now wait a minute [/BAR] [BAR] what the hell does
chopping trees have to do with culinary ? " [/BAR] [BAR] that 's the spirit kid , analyse the lyric
[/BAR] [BAR] from the moment that you hear it , see , cause most do n't have the skill to
[/BAR] [BAR] utilize their ears ' function as a garbage filter [/BAR] [BAR] so their brain gets clogged and congested
[/BAR] [BAR] by the time and the effort that 's invested in illusion [/BAR] [BAR] and by the time 's
definition of reality [/BAR] [BAR] by the time you get the facts , they 're outnumbered in confusion [/BAR] [BAR]
so I come , to get shit off my chest and up in you [/BAR] [BAR] and I come ,
to make you feel at home with your power [/BAR] [BAR] and I come , to plant seeds of responsibility
[/BAR] [BAR] Cause I come , harder than a sleepless cold shower [/BAR] [BAR] refining and refreshing [/BAR] [BAR] reprimanding
those who claim they 're representing by demanding clarity [/BAR] [BAR] Cause when a mouthfull do n't equal an eyeful
, an earful sound awful [/BAR] [BAR] at least that 's how it seems to me [/BAR] [BAR] so I
lead by example in my sound-proof room [/BAR] [BAR] and the comp gets trampled on my wack-proof stage [/BAR] [BAR]
and my answers be ample in the packed classroom [/BAR] [BAR] Cause my thoughts are reflected on an ink-filled page
[/BAR] [BAR] [ Verse 1 ] ( J-Live ) [/BAR] [BAR] So anyway where was I [/BAR] [BAR] Somewhere in
between being tipsy and buzz-eye [/BAR] [BAR] Realize the scene was a little obscene [/BAR] [BAR] Shorty I was seen
walking out with was not the queen but what [/BAR] [BAR] With a little butt-butt , but my gut told
me [/BAR] [BAR] Wake up [/BAR] [BAR] Especially when she went for the car keys like [/BAR] [BAR] Freeze [/BAR]

it home then we might 've got skeezed [/BAR] [BAR] When I wake up in the morning I would n't
've been pleased [/BAR] [BAR] Like Boomerang when Marcus inlay the yellow weaves [/BAR] [BAR] But atleast that night ,
let me escape from the problem [/BAR] [BAR] The mojo was bad intact [/BAR] [BAR] In fact , after that
episode [/BAR] [BAR] Outside of the spot , sober dime hawked at me coming out the car lot [/BAR] [BAR]
She said was n't that sweet [/BAR] [BAR] Are n't you the boy scout [/BAR] [BAR] Was that your good
deed for the night [/BAR] [BAR] No doubt , how 's about you give a drunk monk a quick ride
home [/BAR] [BAR] If you play your cards right [/BAR] [BAR] I 'll cook you breakfast in the morning [/BAR]

Politics , bullshit , Celtics versus Knicks [/BAR] [BAR] New school dancehall and old school kicks [/BAR] [BAR] Even Pro
Tools mixed and shorty was an engineer [/BAR] [BAR] But one night , she put a little something in my

Words of admiration , translation : [/BAR] [BAR] sucker ass , lines , of trash [/BAR] [BAR] Spewing from First
One 's unskilled lips [/BAR] [BAR] That beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp [/BAR] [BAR]
She pimps her innocence as Second One demands entrance [/BAR] [BAR] through the back door . . [/BAR] [BAR] "
Bend over bitch , you know this is what you were born for ; [/BAR] [BAR] to dig those soft
and lotioned knees into the floor -- [/BAR] [BAR] and take it in , that sweetly spread ass like a
real pro whore " [/BAR] [BAR] Her subsequent screams seemed to praise [/BAR] [BAR] Sent messages of pleasure and pain
to his fuck tainted brain [/BAR] [BAR] But her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass [/BAR] [BAR] As he
quicker comes , then Third and Fourth One just as dumb [/BAR] [BAR] Invite themselves to join in [/BAR] [BAR]
Third One wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style [/BAR] [BAR] while Fourth One says , [/BAR] [BAR] " Do
n't she got some DSL 's , make a nigga joint just swell , [/BAR] [BAR] to think ? I
wanna sink my inches , into that bitch 's , [/BAR] [BAR] berry-framed mouth " [/BAR] [BAR] So one goes
North , the other South [/BAR] [BAR] To sanctified places where in-house spirits [/BAR] [BAR] will later wash away all
traces , of their ill-spoken words [/BAR] [BAR] and complacent faces [/BAR] [BAR] And then , like their Minutemen ,
predecessors [/BAR] [BAR] Lude , aggrandized sexual endeavors , end up rough [/BAR] [BAR] Cause neither one of them could
keep that weak shit up [/BAR] [BAR] Corrupt , Fifth One steps to her [/BAR] [BAR] Hip-Hop clothed just to
, think he gonna impress her [/BAR] [BAR] " Hey Slim , I heard you was a spinna -- sit
on up [/BAR] [BAR] top this thing , black dick , and work it like a winner " [/BAR] [BAR]
With the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her [/BAR] [BAR] But suddenly he , stops mid thrust
[/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] * Yvette Smalls ' pager goes off * [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Seems she nameless to

Girl , I 'ma wax that ass , and stick that slit so hard , [/BAR] [BAR] you gonna be
calling me God " [/BAR] [BAR] So he proceeds to poke and prod [/BAR] [BAR] with clumsy finger and wack
sex slinger [/BAR] [BAR] " Condoms make me last longer , " wrong , cause her [/BAR] [BAR] motions of
snatch , however detached from the situation [/BAR] [BAR] cause his pre pre PRE-ejaculation [/BAR] [BAR] It seems she just
wastin [/BAR] [BAR] good pussy and time on dudes like Number Seven [/BAR] [BAR] who ai n't learned their lesson
[/BAR] [BAR] He wants to enter the flesh divine [/BAR] [BAR] by dropping a kind of semi-sweet line [/BAR] [BAR]
" Your honey hole so fine and mile deep ; I 'm gonna leap [/BAR] [BAR] into you like an
ocean do you right and make your head spin " [/BAR] [BAR] So he jumped in and then , he
drowned [/BAR] [BAR] Got lost and found in her Tart Canal [/BAR] [BAR] Slave to the waves , made him
cum for days [/BAR] [BAR] Eighth and last One turn arise [/BAR] [BAR] Plys her with familiar lies [/BAR] [BAR]
Even more familiar still , cause [/BAR] [BAR] him she used to love [/BAR] [BAR] But he never could quite
see above , her mound [/BAR] [BAR] A pound of flesh is all she was , no name no face
or even voice [/BAR] [BAR] So poised , she rises -- Phoenix from the flame [/BAR] [BAR] Finally bored with

up cocks with a fully loaded Glock [/BAR] [BAR] Parts lips , not expressly made for milding dicks [/BAR] [BAR]
and then , she speaks : [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Your shreiks of horror bring me bliss , I must

[BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ BROther ? uestion ] [/BAR] [BAR] I would be lyin if I told you I could
not [/BAR] [BAR] prepare a fat bowl of sticky , grits for a quickie [/BAR] [BAR] Humans get picky ,
and judge it by the thickness [/BAR] [BAR] But if it bends your spoon then add some butter with the
quickness [/BAR] [BAR] I might get a bit smoother , if you move it to a [/BAR] [BAR] better ,
position , that 's probably what she wishin [/BAR] [BAR] You can add some groovy spices , to give it
extra [/BAR] [BAR] But my advice is to first let it simmer [/BAR] [BAR] Hot , if it 's hot
then let the pot sit and cool [/BAR] [BAR] Cause if you spill your milk , we label you beginner
[/BAR] [BAR] Humans gotta know , that I keep my bowl , full of grits [/BAR] [BAR] Swingin with their

my milk kinda sour [/BAR] [BAR] Half and half , part creamer , and skeemer [/BAR] [BAR] That 's why
if it 's grits then it gotta be organic [/BAR] [BAR] Cause if it 's artificial , I panic [/BAR]

too bad , such a nice boy always kind to his motha [/BAR] [BAR] Always say good morning to everybody

bad [/BAR] [BAR] I seen him walkin' toward his house and he was n't smiling [/BAR] [BAR] And he did
n't even say hello [/BAR] [BAR] But I knew he 'd seen something [/BAR] [BAR] Something in the way of
things that it worked on him like it do in will [/BAR] [BAR] And he kept marching faster and faster

Dice Raw , the 5th Dynasty [/BAR] [BAR] and Black Thought sendin out a shout to the Get Fresh Crew
[/BAR] [BAR] and Doug E . [/BAR] [BAR] This beautiful blend , I knew her through a mutual friend [/BAR]
[BAR] She was a work of art , a part of my heart from back then [/BAR] [BAR] A brown
skin singer , with a knack for actin , Alana 's whole attraction [/BAR] [BAR] Just fractionally based on surface
, I got into her mental on purpose [/BAR] [BAR] And with alertness , as I flirt with her emotion
[/BAR] [BAR] Walls we built up out of nervousness was broken [/BAR] [BAR] I reminisce on how this Black Thought
had her open [/BAR] [BAR] Wit da energy that got the whole summertime smokin very hypnotized [/BAR] [BAR] When it
was time we spent time [/BAR] [BAR] It 's no way to rewind or prevent [/BAR] [BAR] time from slipping
away like day , into the dark [/BAR] [BAR] and the way that things fall apart , will make some
start [/BAR] [BAR] to feel more , weak or insecure [/BAR] [BAR] But for whatever reason our relationship remain mature
[/BAR] [BAR] Even when she caught feelings cuz I stay on tour [/BAR] [BAR] As I reflect on before ,
and recap the situation [/BAR] [BAR] I guess from experience , comes education [/BAR] [BAR] We set on a path
to opposite destinations [/BAR] [BAR] It 's best to chalk it up and add it to the elevation [/BAR] [BAR]
Then eventually flow on to lost communication [/BAR] [BAR] I called but lost all information [/BAR] [BAR] And with time
forgot it , it 's not like I 'm all in tears about it [/BAR] [BAR] But the fact still
remains that I miss the Hypnotic [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] Chorus : repeat 2X [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] You 're
a shinin' star [/BAR] [BAR] No matter where you are [/BAR] [BAR] For the world to see [/BAR] [BAR] What
you truly be [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] She was the hypnotic , and potent as a narcotic [/BAR] [BAR] the
bizarre logic of it all , is why the clock tick [/BAR] [BAR] pages of the calendar flip , we
ca n't stop it [/BAR] [BAR] time will either tell the tale , or turn a love toxic [/BAR] [BAR]
now was she real , or an illusion of this optical [/BAR] [BAR] confusion with the accent of ancient Egypt
[/BAR] [BAR] or could it be that she 's the one I was supposed to be with [/BAR] [BAR] and
together walked this twisted , staircase is somethin realistic [/BAR] [BAR] damn , her lips having me addicted to her
presence [/BAR] [BAR] front page material on essence , a queen , imperial before her [/BAR] [BAR] adolescence [/BAR] [BAR]
and as she grew into a woman she became refine [/BAR] [BAR] I never knew another like her in my
lifetime [/BAR] [BAR] so now I travel through a tunnel of space , without a place [/BAR] [BAR] on the
face of this earth , with this pain gettin worse [/BAR] [BAR] drivin me insane , or release I 'm
touchin the brink , of sanity [/BAR] [BAR] to think of how I can link , or contact her [/BAR]
[BAR] I was a fool before , but more wise after the fact [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm analyzin how I
'm wantin her back [/BAR] [BAR] and wonderin exactly where she could be on the map [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm
just sittin here spinning the world on one finger [/BAR] [BAR] reoccuring thoughts of this brown skin singer [/BAR] [BAR]
yo , the psychotic , the hypnotic , yo check it out [/BAR] [BAR] the most melodic hypnotic , yeah

front line [/BAR] [BAR] Being on the front means duckin one time [/BAR] [BAR] The pendulum swingin my way ,
could n't be more blind [/BAR] [BAR] Niggaz talk to the cops ? Not even one time [/BAR] [BAR] 'cause
we all goin down , just like the subprime [/BAR] [BAR] or a cheap-ass half gallon of Ballantine [/BAR] [BAR]
But , hoppin over gates to escape is sublime [/BAR] [BAR] Been through the alley way and down to the
sub line [/BAR] [BAR] Tales from the streets , life of high crime [/BAR] [BAR] to make it to the
bottom , such a high climb [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus 1 ] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Black Thought ]
[/BAR] [BAR] Yo , we obviously need to tone it down a bit [/BAR] [BAR] Runnin 'round town spendin time
like it 's counterfeit [/BAR] [BAR] Everybody catchin hay fever like sinuses [/BAR] [BAR] Step in my arena let me
show y 'all who the highness is [/BAR] [BAR] You might say I could be doing somethin positive [/BAR] [BAR]
Humbled head down low and broke like promises [/BAR] [BAR] Soakin and broken in a joke like comics is [/BAR]
[BAR] Not enough paper to be payin folks compliments [/BAR] [BAR] But when that paper got low , so did
my tolerance [/BAR] [BAR] And it ai n't no TRUTH in a dare , without the consequence [/BAR] [BAR] Listen
if it not for these hood inventions [/BAR] [BAR] I 'd just be another kid from the block with no
intentions [/BAR] [BAR] On the dock of that bay , serving a life sentence [/BAR] [BAR] Even if I 'm
goin to HELL , I 'm gonna make an entrance [/BAR] [BAR] Yeah~ ! Let 'em know I 'm gettin
cheese like omletes is [/BAR] [BAR] but I 'm the toast of the town like Thomas is [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]
[BAR] [ Chorus : Bilal Oliver ] [/BAR] [BAR] We 're all on a journey [/BAR] [BAR] Down the hall
of memories [/BAR] [BAR] Do n't worry 'bout what you ai n't got [/BAR] [BAR] Leave with a little bit
of dignity [/BAR] [BAR] Never loved what I had [/BAR] [BAR] Always felt like I deserved MO ' [/BAR] [BAR]
But when I make it to the other side [/BAR] [BAR] ( Make it to the other side ) [/BAR]
[BAR] That 's when we 'll settle up the score [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Black Thought ] [/BAR] [BAR]
Yo , we did this in remembrance of [/BAR] [BAR] faces from the past , we no longer have an
image of [/BAR] [BAR] Carryin cold-blooded hearts , that never been for love [/BAR] [BAR] Brothers keep goin for theirs
but never get enough [/BAR] [BAR] World travelers that seen it all and did enough [/BAR] [BAR] Only to return
to learn the world was n't big enough [/BAR] [BAR] Damn , how long has it been ? I guess
the jig is up [/BAR] [BAR] Now all I know is I 'm about to wake this nigga up [/BAR]
[BAR] Yeah , that hindsight 20/20 [/BAR] [BAR] Now niggaz dead on the money , try to take something from
me [/BAR] [BAR] It 's a wrap like mummy , undun I am becoming and [/BAR] [BAR] When he 's
tired of runnin , through the layers of the onion [/BAR] [BAR] He 'll probably shed a tear , 'cause
there 'll be no more fast times [/BAR] [BAR] Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign [/BAR]
[BAR] He never had enough and got confused when they asked why [/BAR] [BAR] Life is only a moment in
time and it passed by [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Greg Porn ]
[/BAR] [BAR] I 'm sitting on top of the world ready to jump off [/BAR] [BAR] Thinkin of various ways
to breakin the law [/BAR] [BAR] Thinkin that enough is enough , but still I want more [/BAR] [BAR] Thinkin
of how I 'm playin with fire tht burned my young boy [/BAR] [BAR] By any means necessary , do
n't give a damn [/BAR] [BAR] So every night I 'm on a flight that never lands [/BAR] [BAR] Be
an asshole when the shit hits the fan [/BAR] [BAR] pr bet your life , on a bluff and a
bad hand [/BAR] [BAR] Ca n't win , ca n't lose , get 'em gassed [/BAR] [BAR] Leave 'em leakin
fuel , either way the market moves [/BAR] [BAR] Cash rules kings , queens , prince and princess [/BAR] [BAR]
Every night I 'm crossin a line that ai n't the finish [/BAR] [BAR] Every thought is dark as a
glass of fuckin Guinness [/BAR] [BAR] To far gone to come back to my senses [/BAR] [BAR] Now I 'm
on the edge of my bed makin love to my meds [/BAR] [BAR] Every moments like a pistol to my
head when I 'm gettin mine [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Black Thought ] [/BAR]
[BAR] I drew a two of hearts from a deck of cards [/BAR] [BAR] A stock trick from my empty
repertoire [/BAR] [BAR] Another hopeless story never read at all [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm better off lookin for the end
, where the credits are [/BAR] [BAR] It 's a pain living life against the grain [/BAR] [BAR] I 'm
lookin back and y 'all look the same [/BAR] [BAR] Troy , Mark , and lil ' what 's-his-name ,
memory is rerunnin it all [/BAR] [BAR] It 's the flight of my fall , and it 's right on
the wall [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus : Jazzyfatnastees ] [/BAR] [BAR] I remember , can you remember [/BAR]
[BAR] how it was ? I do [/BAR] [BAR] remember , do you ? [/BAR] [BAR] I remember , can
you remember [/BAR] [BAR] how it was ? I do [/BAR] [BAR] remember , do you ? [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR]
[BAR] [ Black Thought ] [/BAR] [BAR] I used to ride the train to the same two stops [/BAR] [BAR]
and look at the graffiti on the rooftops [/BAR] [BAR] Like the same song playin on the jukebox [/BAR] [BAR]
Joint called " Faded Polaroids in a Shoebox " [/BAR] [BAR] Regardless to what the cadence is [/BAR] [BAR] It
ca n't be forgotten like old acquaintances [/BAR] [BAR] I realize how depressin of a place it is [/BAR] [BAR]
and when I notice my reflection , whose face it is [/BAR] [BAR] [/BAR] [BAR] [ Chorus ] [/BAR] [BAR]

] [/BAR] [BAR] It 's only human to express the way you really feel [/BAR] [BAR] But that same humanity
is my Achilles ' heel [/BAR] [BAR] A leopard ca n't change his spots and never will [/BAR] [BAR] So
I 'm forever ill , now I can never chill [/BAR] [BAR] What 's keepin me from breakin out like
Benadryl [/BAR] [BAR] when my baptism of fire resulted in a kill ? [/BAR] [BAR] Sometimes it 's as cut
and dry as a business deal [/BAR] [BAR] You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill [/BAR]
[BAR] But you remember still . . . [/BAR] [BAR] [ Aaron Livingston ] [/BAR] [BAR] Like when autumn leaves

[BAR] Look , and what I did came back to me eventually [/BAR] [BAR] The music , played on and
told me I was meant to be awake [/BAR] [BAR] It 's unresolved like everything I had at stake [/BAR]
[BAR] Illegal activity controls my black symphony [/BAR] [BAR] Orchestrated like it happened oncidentally [/BAR] [BAR] Oh . . there
